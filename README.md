> **Abstract**: What is the effect of legislature size on social welfare? While the literature suggests that increasing the number of legislators broadens political representation and raises government expenditures, its implications for public service provision remain understudied. In this paper, we propose a model of legislative XXXX that exploit exogenous changes in city-council size in Brazil and show that adding a legislator increases education and healthcare indicators. XXXX Education quality and preventive health care remain unaffected, but primary school enrolment and infant mortality significantly improve. To investigate the mechanism, we surveyed former councillors and analysed 346,553 bills proposed between 2005 and 2008. This analysis shows that politicians prefer to provide private and targeted goods instead of public goods. This paper has implications for the design of legislative institutions.
