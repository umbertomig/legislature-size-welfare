# To Do:

* Revise the abstract

* Check if "2.1 Model Setup" is an appropriate section title

* Check whether the description of the paper by Catalinac et al (2020) is
  correct

* Check whether we write about "scope conditions" as mentioned by the third
  reviewer

* Revise the text sentence-by-sentence to make sure we address all the concerns
  raised by the reviewers

* Proofread the text one last time to make sure there are no spelling or
  grammar errors

* Write the memo

* Profit! :-)
