# A Model of Legislature Size and Service Provision (Proofs)

In this section, we show the proofs for the formal model we present in the article.

\begin{proposition}
Public goods provision increases with larger legislatures if governing costs decrease in larger legislatures.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
To prove this result, we need to show that the mayor's expected utility satisfies the increasing differences in $g$ and $N$. This means that, when increasing the size of the council, the optimal solution $g^*$ should also increase. However, as $N$ increases discretely, we cannot take the cross-partial derivative on $g$ and $N$ or use the implicit function theorem. Instead, we use monotone comparative statics to derive these results \citep{milgrom1994monotone}.

The mayor's expected utility satifies the increasing differences in $g$ and $N$ when, for $g > g'$ and $N+1 > N$,\footnote{The requirement that the decision and type space are a complete lattice is satisfied for $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{N}$.} we have:

\[
\mathbb{E}\text{U}(g, N+1) - \mathbb{E}\text{U}(g', N+1) \geq \mathbb{E}\text{U}(g, N) - \mathbb{E}\text{U}(g', N)
\]

After some substitutions, we have:

\[
u(R - g - C_G(N+1)) + B_M\pi(g) - u(R - g' - C_G(N+1)) - B_M\pi(g') \geq
u(R - g - C_G(N)) + B_M\pi(g) - u(R - g' - C_G(N)) - B_M\pi(g')
\]

Which is equal to:

\[
u(R - g - C_G(N+1)) - u(R - g' - C_G(N+1)) \geq
u(R - g - C_G(N)) - u(R - g' - C_G(N))
\]

By multiplying both sides by $\dfrac{1}{g - g'}$ and taking the limit when $g \rightarrow g'$, we have:

\[
u'(R - g - C_G(N+1)) \geq
u'(R - g - C_G(N))
\]

It is now clear that the function satisfies the increasing differences in $g$ and $N$ when the governing costs of a $N+1$-sized city council are lower than the governing costs of a $N$-sized city council:

\[
C_G(N+1) \leq C_G(N)
\]

\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
In the \textit{non-partisan reversal} mechanism, governing costs always increase when legislature size increases.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}

Comparing city councils of size $N$ with those of size $N+1$, we find that the difference is costs is:

\[
\begin{aligned}
C_G(N+1) - C_G(N) \ = \ & \dfrac{(N+1)\delta R}{2(N+1) + 1} - \dfrac{N \delta R}{2N + 1}\\
 = \ & \dfrac{\delta R}{(2N+3)(2N+1)} \\
> \ &0
\end{aligned}
\]

Therefore, governing costs always increase when legislature size increases.

\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
In the \textit{non-partisan reversal} mechanism, public goods provision decreases as legislature size increases.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proposition}
In the \textit{hybrid reversal} mechanism, if $\gamma \leq \dfrac{1}{p}\left[ \dfrac{1}{(2N+1)(2N+3)} \right]$, then governing costs increase as legislature size increases. Otherwise, such costs decrease when legislature size increases.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}

When we compare the costs of $N$ versus $N+1$ legislators, we find that:

\[
\begin{aligned}
C_G(N+1) - C_G(N) \ = \ & \dfrac{N+1}{2}\left( \dfrac{2\delta R}{2(N+1)+1} - p \right) + \left(\dfrac{N+1}{2} - \gamma (N+1) \right)p \\
& - \dfrac{N}{2}\left( \dfrac{2\delta R}{2N+1} - p \right) - \left(\dfrac{N}{2} - \gamma N \right)p \\
 = \ & \dfrac{\delta R}{(2N+3)(2N+1)}\left[ 1-\gamma (2N+1)(2N+3)p \right]
\end{aligned}
\]

The conditions for the difference in governing costs to decrease when legislature size increases are as follows:

\[
\gamma \geq \dfrac{1}{p}\left[\dfrac{1}{(2N+3)(2N+1)}\right] \equiv \underline{\gamma}
\]

\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
In the \textit{hybrid reversal} mechanism, when the chances of electing a mayor-aligned city councilor are sufficiently high, then increasing council size lowers the bargaining costs for mayors.
\end{corollary}

## Online 2016 Former City Councilors Survey

We ran an online survey asking 174 councilors about their representation duties and how mayors allocate public services to expand his or her government coalition. The services we include are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Councilors Job Appointments}: Whether mayors appoint supporters of the city councilors to bureaucratic jobs (source: own survey).
\item \textbf{Councilors Demands}: Whether mayors satisfy the public service demands of an allied councilor (e.g., build a health clinic in a councilor's neighborhood) (source: own survey).
\item \textbf{Councilors Personal Requests}: Whether mayors satisfy the private requests of an allied councilor (e.g., hire an ally in the bureaucracy) (source: own survey).
\item \textbf{Councilors Legislation}: Whether mayors support the councilors' legislative agenda (source: own survey).
\item \textbf{Councilors Constructions}: Whether mayors support councilors' requests for more public works (i.e., fix potholes in the councilor's neighborhoods) (source: own survey).
\end{itemize}

# Threshold Manipulation, Sorting, and Pre-Treatment Consistency

\citet{McCrary2008} proposes a measure of the distributional imbalance around the discontinuity, testing whether cases are more abundant on either side of the cutoff. In our sample, the McCrary statistic is 0.391 (SE $=$ 0.299), showing no evidence of manipulation.

We also run the \citet{cattaneo2019simple} manipulation test, which is based on the density of the local polynomial estimator. We use local polynomials ranging from first to fourth order. As the null hypothesis implies that there is no manipulation, the $p$-values for each polynomial order are: local linear ($p$-value $=0.442$); quadratic ($p$-value $=0.740$); cubic ($p$-value $=0.998$); and quartic ($p$-value $=0.620$). Therefore, the test also shows no evidence of manipulation.

To provide an overview of the data dispersion, Figure \ref{sampleplot} plots the municipalities by their proximity to the cutoffs. In the map, we give the contour of every Brazilian city, coloring it by the proximity to the council size thresholds. Darker colors represent municipalities closer to the population thresholds. In regression discontinuity models, the closer a city is to the cutoff, the more influential it is in the estimation. Figure \ref{sampleplot} also shows that the municipalities around the cutoff are reasonably well distributed across the country.

# Identification Strategy in Regression Discontinuity Designs with Multiple Thresholds
\label{ISMT}

When estimating regression discontinuities with multiple cutoffs, authors usually pool all the discontinuities together to estimate the treatment effect on the outcomes of interest \citep{cattaneo2016interpreting}. Let $C = \{c_0, c_1, \cdots, c_n, c_{n+1}\}$ be the set of cutoff thresholds associated with the running variable $X$. The outcome variable is assumed to be $Y$. In the pooled model, the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) is:

\[
LATE_{no\_controls} \quad = \quad \E \left[ \lim_{x \downarrow c_i} \E[Y_i | X_i] - \lim_{x \uparrow c_i} \E[Y_i | X_i] | \forall c_i \in C \right]
\]

Nevertheless, this may be problematic in our case as municipal characteristics may vary between cutoffs. For instance, population imbalance is a known source of heterogeneity. To ensure that cases are comparable, we add a set of controls $Z_i$ to reduce heterogeneity. For instance, the population that determines the change from one threshold to another also determines all the cutoffs. As the population runs smoothly around each cutoff, it makes this variable an ideal control to add to our models. The new estimator is:

\[
LATE_{controls} \quad = \quad \E \left[ \lim_{x \downarrow c_i} \E[Y_i | X_i] - \lim_{x \uparrow c_i} \E[Y_i | X_i] | \forall c_i \in C, Z_i \right]
\]

The inclusion of controls in our model has another purpose, which is to improve the efficiency of our estimates \citep{calonico2019regression}. We add five controls to the main specifications. We include the 2003 population because it conditions the multiple threshold assignments. We add GDP per capita to control for Brazil's economic expansion during the 2000s. We also add the number of seats in 2000 to ensure that our results come from the current legislature size and not from past seat allocations. Year was included in the models to control for seasonal effects. Finally, we add a dummy for Northeast states. The Northeast region received considerable attention from the Federal Government in the 2000s. According to \citet{de2015politica}, in 2003 the Lula administration recreated the Superintendency for the Development of the Northeast (SUDENE), investing BRL 84 Billion from 2003 to 2010. This amounts to around 70% of all targeted regional investments. One example of these investments is that the federal government created about 100 new universities in the Northeast region during that period.  Moreover, infant mortality in the Brazilian Northeast decreased from 22.4 deaths per 1000 infants born in 2005 to 19.6 deaths in 2008 largely due to substantial federal investments in the region. In turn, education quality improved from 2.69 in 2005 to a 3.14 score in 2007 (0 to 10 quality of education score). For this reason, adding a dummy for Northeast states is essential for ensuring the consistency and the efficiency of our estimates.

We use a triangular kernel in our estimations, which gives more weigh to municipalities closer to each cutoff. To compute the optimal bandwidth, we use the \citet{CCT2014} method. We vary the bandwidth from 50\% to 200\% of the optimal bandwidth size to assess whether our results are robust to bandwidth choice. We also use cluster-robust standard errors at the municipal level.

As it is uncommon for regression discontinuity designs to include control variables, we run a series of simulations to show that controlling for the variable that determines the assignment helps improve both the consistency and the efficiency of the estimates.

Consider data distributed according to one of the four forms depicted in Figure \ref{simRDdd}. We add nine thresholds, at 0.1, 0.2, and so on until 0.9, to create different outcomes. The first three are sharp changes. First, we vary from one to 10, moving one step at each shift. In the second case, we add 1 to the first discontinuity, zero to the second, and -1 to the third, repeating this pattern for the remaining cutoffs. The estimated change should be equal to zero. In the third model, we again add one to the first cutoff, but $1+0.9$ to the second, $1+0.9+0.8$ to the third, and repeat this process until the last cutoff. This simulates a diminishing effect from one cutoff to the other. The previous three outcomes are the same as depicted here, plus a Normal random disturbance with mean equal to zero and variance equal to 0.01. We then run a thousand Monte Carlo simulations for each combination, fitting regressions with and without the running variable as a covariate.

    \end{minipage}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\pagebreak

A consistent estimator should fit either the first or the fourth data distributions.  In the second distribution, the change should be equal to $(1, 0, -1, 1, 0, -1, 1, 0, -1)$, and the average change here is equal to zero. In the third model, the change should be $(0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1)$ and the average change should be equal to $0.5$. We display the results in Figure \ref{estimDGP}, showing that the models with control variables are the most consistent and efficient.

# Placebo Regressions for the Political Mechanism
\label{placmechmain}

Here we present the placebo regressions for the mechanism-aggregated outcomes. In Panel A of the main paper, we run the regression on alternative explanations. Only the number of female councilors changed significantly, but that is to be expected in at least 10% of cases. We have not collected data on non-white legislators for the placebo cutoffs; therefore, we leave it blank. In Panel B, we have the placebo regressions for the primary mechanism, which concerns bargaining costs and public appointed employees. As expected, the placebo regressions are statistically insignificant.

# Sensitivity Analysis of Bandwidth Selection
\label{sensffapp}

In this section we present the sensitivity tests for bandwidth selection. Following the suggestion of \citet{Bueno2015}, we vary the bandwidth from 50\% to 200\% of the \citet{CCT2014} estimate.

# Sensitivity Analysis of State Characteristics
\label{sensstate}

Given its massive size and large social inequalities, Brazil presents considerable geographic variation. In this respect, some states have such poor health care and education systems that they could be driving our results. We run the analyses dropping one state at a time to investigate this statewide heterogeneity. The results are in Figures \ref{graphsensstatedrop1} and \ref{graphsensstatedrop2}.

# Sensitivity Analysis of Model Functional Form
\label{sensfuncform}

In the paper, we run all the regressions using local linear polynomials. However, to assess the robustness of our results, we also run every model using different polynomial orders, from local linear to quartic, showing that our results are robust to different regression functional forms. Figure \ref{graphsensff} presents the results.

# Sensitivity Analysis of Covariates
\label{senstcovapp}

Control variables play a major role in our model. To study the sensitivity to controls, we run the same regressions for all possible control combinations. Figure \ref{graphsenscontrol} displays the results for this sensitivity test.\footnote{\textit{NC} stands for No Controls. The controls used are \textit{gdp}, the municipal GDP in a given year; \textit{nseats2000}, the number of seats before the 2003 Supreme Court decision; \textit{northeast}, a dummy variable for Northeast Brazil; \textit{pop2003}, population in 2003; and \textit{year}.}

\end{minipage}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{landscape}

For instance, changes in the controls variables substantially affect the quality of elementary education, where some sets of controls lead to a positive effect. However, most combinations of controls were insignificant.

We included the model with all controls to be conservative in our estimations. This is because the full model is significant only when most of the combinations also are significant. Regarding the point estimates, our variable choices tend to keep the models which have smaller coefficient sizes.

# Sensitivity Analysis of Additional Cutoffs

Here we evaluate the robustness of our results when we vary the number of cutoffs. We run a series of regressions limiting the population sizes to half the cutoffs, starting from the second cutoff to the last. This strategy is similar to adding one cutoff at a time. The results are stable and do not change our main conclusions. Moreover, there are no clear increasing or decreasing patterns, which would indicate the existence of differential returns. Figures \ref{senscut1} and \ref{senscut2} display the results for the main cutoffs.

# Mayors' Characteristics, Revenues, and Transfers from the Central Government

Two alternative explanations may confound our results. First, the mayor's selection could be affected by the size of the city council. Thus, public welfare can improve due to the quality of the mayor and not because of the partisan mechanism we describe. Second, the partisan mechanism could be capturing a dynamic similar to Weingast et al.'s [-@Weingastetal1981] "law of 1/n", whereby welfare improvements are caused by higher available revenues. This section shows that none of these concerns are valid in our case.

## Mayors' Characteristics

We select four characteristics of the city mayors: gender, level of schooling, whether the mayor was reelected in 2004, and whether the mayor was reelected in 2008. The results in Table \ref{appmaychar} show no variation in council size and mayoral characteristics.

## Revenues and Transfers

In Table \ref{apptrev}, we run another series of models on federal transfers and revenue raised within the municipalities. There is only a negligible effect on education transfers, yet it is barely significant at 10%. The other indicators remain insignificant.

# Legislation Dataset

In Fall 2018, we collected data on the legislation approved by the city councils of 63 municipalities, all of which were 10 thousand inhabitants away from the thresholds we discussed above. There are 202 municipalities that are 10 thousand inhabitants away from the cutoff, but only 63 had relevant information about local legislation between 2005 to 2008.

We hand-coded 1\% of the dataset (3,466 cases) and applied a Supporting Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to the remaining 99\% cases to classify the legislation. First, we trained and tested the accuracy of the SVM classifier on 80\% of the dataset. Then, we ran the training algorithm on the complete hand-coded data and predicted the remaining cases.\footnote{We tested SVM, Naïve Bayes, Random Forests, and Neural Networks for this task. We have chosen SVM as it gives the highest prediction rate of all of the algorithms we have tried. We use a simple bag-of-words classifier provided by the \texttt{RTextTools} package for \texttt{R} \citep{collingwood2013rtexttools}.}

We hand-coded these data according to four characteristics:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Local Public Goods}: Whether the bills provided a local public good or service to citizens. For instance, bills that aim to fix street potholes, staff a given health clinic, or purchase equipment to a given school.
\item \textbf{Oversight}: Legislation requesting information on the status of service provision.
\item \textbf{Others}: Legislation not categorized as any of the previous two, such as honors to notable citizens.
\item \textbf{Health Care and Education}: Bills on education and health care, broadly defined.
\end{enumerate}

After we classified all the bills, we added the frequency of each category to the main paper. We have also added the productivity per legislator, which consists of the ratio of the legislation approved in the municipality in the four-year term, divided by the council size. As expected, the results changed little when we used this alternative measure.

# City Councilors Survey
\label{appsurv}

From November 21^st^ to December 1^st^, 2016, we surveyed former city councilors elected for the 2005-2008 term. We asked them how mayors secure electoral support, which services are commonly discussed in the city council, and which services give them the highest electoral yield.

We sent 3,240 emails to politicians who had ran in the 2016 election and held public offices in 2005. On December 1^st^, we closed the pool and obtained 174 responses. Figure \ref{geodistrsurv} displays the distribution of responses.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{minipage}{1 \linewidth}

      \bigskip
      \label{geodistrsurv}
    \end{minipage}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

To weight the survey, we use the Legislative Census, conducted by *Interlegis* on the behalf of the Brazilian Senate. The company was hired to improve the quality of Brazilian government branches. We include the following categories in the weighting procedure: region of Brazil, legislature size (9 to 15 or more), gender, and age less than 39. We use the proportions in each bin to weight the graphs and statistics generated after the raking process.\footnote{The \texttt{survey} package for \texttt{R} describes the raking process in more detail \citep{lumley2004analysis}. In summary, it iterates the post-stratification procedure until the sample marginals match the population marginals for all variables.} Table \ref{tabweight} shows the sample, population, and weighted proportions.

The survey included the following questions of interest:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item No Brasil é comum que o prefeito tenha de negociar para ter maioria na Câmara de Vereadores. Com que frequência, o(a) Sr(a) acha que o prefeito usa os seguintes dispositivos para conseguir apoio?
    \item Quais dessas atividades o(a) Sr(a) acredita serem mais comuns no trabalho da maioria dos vereadores?
    \item Quais dessas atividades o(a) Sr(a) acredita que ajudam mais um vereador durante a eleição?
\end{enumerate}

English translation:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In Brazil, mayors usually negotiate to establish a government majority in the city council. How often do you think mayors use the following goods in exchange for support?
    \item Which of those activities do city councilors perform most often in their duties?
    \item Which of the following activities do you believe helps city councilors the most in elections?
\end{enumerate}

The second question is particularly relevant to our argument, as it indicates whether councilors engage in activities that give them high electoral yields. Figure \ref{commonservice} shows the results for each of the activities we analyzed.
